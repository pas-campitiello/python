MOSCOW — The country does not exist, so it has neither an army nor any real citizens, 
though it has acquired a feisty following of would-be patriots online. Starting on Thursday, 
however, the fictional state, Veishnoriya, a distillation of the Kremlin’s darkest fears about the West, 
becomes the target of the combined MILITARY might of Russia and its ally Belarus.

The nation was invented to provide an enemy to confront DURING a six-day joint military exercise 
that is expected to be the biggest display of Russian military power since the end of the Cold War a quarter-century ago.

The exercise, known as Zapad-2017, is the latest iteration of a series of training maneuvers 
that began under the Soviet Union in the 1970s. After a long break following the collapse of communism, 
Zapad was revived in 1999 and then was expanded after Vladimir V. PUTIN became president at the end of that year.
