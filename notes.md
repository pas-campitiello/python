## Python 2+ or Python 3+?

Arguably, Python became famous starting from the version 2.0.  
But which is the most important version to use or to start with?

After some readings online about Python usage, especially 

* https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3
* https://www.quora.com/Is-it-better-to-use-Python-2-or-3-in-2016
* https://hynek.me/articles/python3-2016/
* http://ianozsvald.com/2016/06/20/results-for-which-version-of-python-2vs3-do-london-data-scientists-use/

my feeling is that there is not a precise answer to the question, yet.  
It depends mainly on dependencies with old codebases / libraries,  
or deployment environments supporting only old versions of the language.

Python 3+ is the future for sure, but currently (Feb 2017) these seem to be the general rules:

- if you are a beginner, learning Python at school or by yourself, then use Python 3+
- if you are going to start a fresh new project with the latest technologies, then use Python 3+
- if you are going to start a fresh new project using old libraries supporting only Python 2+, hence alternatively
  - you can use Python 2+
  - you can try use Python 3+ and cope with possible backward compatibility 
- if you will deploy your code in an environment supporting only Python 2+, then use Python 2+ 
  - in case you decide to use Python 3+, it can be tricky to cope with backward compatibility, but not impossible
- in all the other cases use Python 2+

I'm in the first condition, beginner, new learner, then I will use Python 3.6.
